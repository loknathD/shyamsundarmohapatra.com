D, D.Litt 25th Jan 1929&#8212; 22nd April 2006<\/strong><\/p><p><strong>Dr. Mohapatra who was born to a Zamindar family, did his schooling at Balasore, Odisha and graduation at Fakir Mohan College, During school days he fought against the British administration and was kept in police custody. Prominent politicians of that period including Dr. H.K Mehtab(who later became Chief Minister of Odisha &amp; Governor of Bombay) adored him. Later, he went to Calcutta to pursue his master&#8217;s degree at Presidency College and then law degree at Calcutta Law College. During that period he came in close contact with Dr. Bidhan Chandra Roy. Dr. Mohapatra became his blue-eyed boy. He became a prominent labour leader in the unorganized yet prominent Jute industry of Calcutta. During his college tenure he became the President of Jute Workers Federation. Dr. B.C Roy took keen interest in Dr. Mohapatra who was instrumental in the successful election of the Chief Minister. Calcutta became Dr. Mohapatra&#8217;s second home as he spoke a much better Bengali language. Having become the student body head of Presidency College, he also became the editor of \u201cAshantakali&#8221;, one of the richest Oriya magazine in those days at a time when Oriya literature was on its decline. He completed his M. A, from Presidency College, L.L.B from Calcutta University and doctorate from Jamia Milia University, New Delhi and Doctor of Literature from Kyung Hee University, Seoul, South Korea.<\/strong><\/p><p><strong>During the turmoil of labour unrest in Bengal, Dr. Mohapatra got married to Dr. Radha Devi, the first and only lady doctor of the Balasore coast , who was practicing in Calcutta. In those days such inter-caste marriages were unheard of, yet, much to his parents&#8217; chagrin he dared to change the social norms.<\/strong><\/p><p><strong>Dr. B.C. Roy, chief Minister of West Bengal, wanted Dr. Mohapatra to join political mainstream in Bengal. But due to demands of personal life, he joined United States Information Services at Calcutta. He was then to join Damodar Valley Corporation as their Public Relation Officer, and later became Chief of Safety in Dhanbad mines(where he got acclaims and accolades from the State and Central governments).<\/strong><\/p><p><strong>Then Odisha beckoned, his wife Dr. Radha Devi having shifted her base to Balasore. Dr. Mohapatra encouraged and was instrumental in establishing the first women&#8217;s organization in Odisha, which is still standing tall. This women&#8217;s body has a school for physically and mentally challenged children. To help the economically poor women, a printing press and a coir-making unit has been established,<\/strong><\/p><p><strong>Dr. Mohapatra besides being the editor of \u201cAshantakali&#8221; was the correspondent of Reuter and founder editor of\u201cDiganta&#8221; along with the Gyanapith Awardee Manoj Das. At the inception of his political career in Odisha, he was first District President, then Vice-President, and later Secretary of Odisha Congress Party. He fought for Sarehikala Kharsuan regions, which rightfully belonged to Odisha yet got annexed to neighboring states. His eloquence at Faridabad Congress Committee Annual meet impressed likes of Gulzarlilal Nanda, Babu Jagjivan Ram and Mrs. Gandhi and Dr. Mohapatra was asked to contest election in Odisha. A rare opportunity was bestowed and he fought election from two places,i.e Rourkela and Balasore. This was a rare feat and he won both seats with great margin. He retained the Balasore Parliamentary seat and his political &amp; diplomatic innings started in the Capital, Delhi.<\/strong><\/p><p><strong>Being in close proximity to the corridors of power (those days they were Indira Gandhi, Sanjay Gandhi, Mr. Antulay, Gundu Rao, Mr. Patil), he was entrusted with bettering external relationship with foreign countries. Entrusted as the Chairman of the External Affairs Cell, he developed party-to-party protocol with Russia, Iraq, Bangladesh, Sweden, Norway, Nicaragua and Argentina.. During the Bangladesh war, Dr. Mohapatra negotiated the safe return and establishment of Mujib-ur-Rehman. The Falkland war saw Dr. Mohapatra as the first official emissary of Indira Gandhi to Argentina. So overwhelmed were the premier and Parliament of Argentina that Dr. Mohapatra was conferred with the highest Civilian Award, \u201dAl Marito\u201d, the first and only Indian to receive this award.<\/strong><\/p><p><strong>During the days of emergency when Indira Gandhi was at the receiving end of all and sundry, Dr. Mohapatra stood by her. Her image was devastatingly low in all developed countries. Dr. Mohapatra stationed himself in London and New York mobilizing print and T.V. media, politicians and overseas Indians. He formed \u201cOverseas India&#8221; (now termed Pravasi Bharatiya). His interviews both at B.B.C &amp; Voice of America were highly lauded. Dr. Mohapatra constructively managed to raise stock of Mrs. Gandhi in those countries where she was much maligned. In this process, he became a close associate of the Gandhi family.<\/strong><\/p><p><strong>In the mid 80s, Dr. Mohapatra was elected to Rajya Sabha at the behest of Indira and Sanjay. Then he was appointed as the General Secretary of All India Congress Committee, the first such appointee from Eastern India. He was in charge of 11 states, spokesperson for the party and Chairman of foreign affairs cell. In that capacity he signed party to party organizational contract with Bath Party of Iraq, Communist Party of Russia, ruling party of Argentina and Chinese Communist Party. He had befriended heads of states, Presidents and Prime Ministers of almost all major countries. He had profound knowledge over most Indian languages, specially Hindi, Bengali, Oriya, Assamese, English, Urdu, and <\/strong><strong>Punjabi.<\/strong><\/p><p><strong>Dr. Mohapatra was a rare breed of leader who reached the zenith of political career at an early age of mid-fifties. He was disillusioned by the craftiness of today&#8217;s politics and almost took sabbatical from political activities. He was invited three times to the Presidential election of United States and once to Kyrgyztan, as political election observer. There are hardly any places in the world that he had not visited. He taught at Jamia Milia Islamia, New Delhi; Kyung Hee University, Seoul and Institute of Alternative Studies in Oslo. He was made the Mayor of London City for one day.He was given the key to the City of Oslo, Norway, a rare honor for any Non-Norwegian person. After a stint at the Center of Strategic Studies in Georgetown University, he promoted &#8216;Foreign Affairs Club of India and Institute of Diplomatic Studies&#8217; at a time when there was no alternative THINK TANK in India.Scores of Presidents , Ambassadors, Diplomats, Research scholars, media persons were associated with this organization.<\/strong><\/p><p><strong>Dr.Mohapatra had a special corner for the dwindling Parsee community. He used to say if India has become what it is today its because of people like J.R.D, Homi Bhaba and his kinds of Parseees. As a true Congressman , he promoted Dadabhai Naoroji International Foundation to felicitate proud sons and daughters of India. This body was a joint venture with Prime Minister John Major and Dr.L.M.Singhvi the then Indian High Commissioner of India in which Dr. Mohapatra played the crucial role of leadership.At Dr. Mohapatra&#8217;s initiative Dadabhai&#8217;s portrait(who was one of the founder member of Indian Congress and first Asian M.P. in U.K.) was hung in both British and Indian Parliaments. Towards his end he penned down few books \u201c Kichi Katha Kichi Byatha\u201d(some tales &amp; some pains), and a collection of his poetries.<\/strong><\/p><p><strong>He is survived by his wife Dr. Radha Devi Mohapatra,two sons Subhankar Mohapatra and Dr. Jyoti Mohapatra,Daughter minati, and grand children Ashavaree,Sanak, Manish and Meghna Manasweeni and daughter in laws Mamata Mohapatra and Gopamudra Mohapatra.<\/strong><\/p>\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/section>\n\t\t\t\t<section class=\"elementor-section elementor-top-section elementor-element elementor-element-ed8d2cb elementor-section-boxed elementor-section-height-default elementor-section-height-default\" data-id=\"ed8d2cb\" data-element_type=\"section\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-container elementor-column-gap-default\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-column elementor-col-100 elementor-top-column elementor-element elementor-element-83201f7\" data-id=\"83201f7\" data-element_type=\"column\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-wrap elementor-element-populated\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-34f8afa elementor-widget elementor-widget-image\" data-id=\"34f8afa\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"image.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img decoding=\"async\" width=\"696\" height=\"208\" src=\"https:\/\/shyamsundarmohapatra.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/IMG_20210625_153335.jpg\" class=\"attachment-large size-large\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https:\/\/shyamsundarmohapatra.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/IMG_20210625_153335.jpg 696w, https:\/\/shyamsundarmohapatra.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/IMG_20210625_153335-300x90.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px\" \/>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/section>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>About Dr. Shyamsundar Mohapatra (FORMER MEMBER OF PARLIAMENT, LOKSABHA AND RAJYASABHA) Late Dr.(Prof) Shyam Sundar Mohapatra, M.A, Ph.
